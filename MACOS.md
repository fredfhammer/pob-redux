# macOS

Apple Silicon (arm64). Intel Macs are not built.

## Running it

Download the `.dmg`, drag the app to Applications, done. Nothing else to install: the app uses the
system WKWebView, so there is no equivalent of the WebView2 download on Windows or the
`libwebkit2gtk` packages on Linux.

Builds live in `~/Documents/Path of Building (PoE2)/Builds` and `~/Documents/Path of Building/Builds`,
the same as every other platform, so a Path of Building install shares the same files.

Until the app is signed with a Developer ID and notarized, Gatekeeper blocks it on first launch. On
macOS 15 Sequoia or later, open System Settings, go to **Privacy & Security**, scroll to the note that
PoB Redux was blocked and click **Open Anyway**, then confirm. macOS 11 to 14 still let you right-click
the app and choose **Open**, which shows the same warning with an Open button. Clearing the quarantine
flag works on any version:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/PoB Redux.app"
```

## Building it

Only for working on the app. Users do not need any of this.

Most Macs already have Homebrew and the Apple toolchain. On the machine this port was developed on,
already present were **Homebrew 6.0.22**, **Xcode 27.0** and **Node 26.8.2** (Homebrew). Newly
installed were **Rust 1.98.1** and **Bun 1.4.2**.

A C compiler is required because the first build compiles LuaJIT from source. Full Xcode works; the
Command Line Tools alone are normally enough (`xcode-select --install`). Either way the licence must
be accepted once, or `clang` refuses to run and the build fails on LuaJIT:

```sh
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

Then:

```sh
brew install oven-sh/bun/bun
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Rustup does not touch your `PATH` unless you let it, so add Cargo to the shell if you skipped that:

```sh
echo '. "$HOME/.cargo/env"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Path of Building itself is not vendored in this repo. Clone both upstreams next to it at the commits
pinned in `pob-sync.toml`, or point `POB_SOURCE` at them:

```sh
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding-PoE2.git
git clone https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding.git
cd pob-redux
bun install
bun run sync          # vendors both into src-tauri/resources. Run before the first build.
bun run tauri build   # .app and .dmg land in target/release/bundle/
```

Expect roughly 7 GB once everything is in place: about 2 GB of upstream git history, 480 MB vendored
into `src-tauri/resources`, and a `target/` directory that reaches 4.7 GB.

## Signing

Releases are ad-hoc signed: `tauri.conf.json` sets `signingIdentity` to `"-"`, so the bundler signs the
whole `.app`. Without it, only the executable carries the linker's signature, nothing else in the
bundle is sealed, and a downloaded copy fails Gatekeeper as "damaged" instead of showing the prompt
above. To check a build:

```sh
codesign --verify --deep --strict -vv "target/release/bundle/macos/PoB Redux.app"
```

Hardened runtime is off. An ad-hoc build with it on is killed at launch, before the engine boots, and
it is only needed for notarization.

Signing with a Developer ID means setting `signingIdentity` to that identity and turning
`hardenedRuntime` back on. PoB's calculations run under LuaJIT, whose trace compiler writes native
arm64 code and then executes it, so the hardened runtime needs `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit` from
`entitlements.plist`. That has not been tested with a real Developer ID, because it needs a paid Apple
Developer account.
